**1\. App Idea**  
Our game is a competitive 2d ‘board game’ where players compete against each other to get a line of tokens on a large board by making lines on a smaller board.

**2\. Target Audience**  
This game is aimed at those who want to play a more advanced version of tic tac toe, with a bit of extra strategy.

**3\. Goals and Vision**  
The goal is to create a fun game that inspires strategy and competition. The game will have features that the players can choose from to make their experience more interesting.

**4\. Key Features**

	•	**Multiple board layers** with changing size of board.

	•	**Challenge mode / Difficulty change** that lets the player choose how difficult they want their game to be.

	•	**Power-ups** that give the player special abilities for a limited time.

	•	**Single-player and Multiplayer modes** that allows the player to play against AI and/or with changes in how many are needed in a line to win a board.

	•	**Progress tracking/Login ability** so players can save and continue their game.

**5\. Success Criteria**  
This game will be considered successful if it has no major bugs, is enjoyable to play, allows the players to practice strategy, and provides a sense of challenge for the players.

**6\. Technical Requirements**  
The game will be developed for PC and web to start, but can be adapted to any platform by changing the type of input that is received. It needs to translate control inputs to movements on the boards in the game. There should be an option to login and save/load games.
