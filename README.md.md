\# \*\*Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe\*\*

\#\# \*\*Project Description\*\*  
This is a tic-tac-toe clone, based on the ‘Ultimate’ version with extra abilities. The goal is to win a row in one box, and that box then gets turned into a tile for the next board layer. Each box/board completion earns the player who completed it points. The game has different modes that can be chosen to enhance challenge, skill, and enjoyability.
